# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Technologies Used 1. React App Setup (JSX, HTML, CSS and JavaScript) 2. node and Node package manager 3. Githup to publish the code and webpages.

Requirements to Solution Steps:

1. Firstly looked at the basic output expected by exploring the sample screenshot of the solution and Analysed it to determine which technology can be used to solve the problem.
2. Once Technology is finalized, (I have chose to do this solution using REACT) setup the development environement.
3. Identified all the components required to build the solution.
4. Started with building component by component. In this shopping cart solution, I have identified the following components like Header, Product Display and Order summary components.
5. This solution is involved by having a product array of objects defined and used to display on the page. Next using props, Hooks and state of REACT, the event handling and managing the cart items dynamically move in and out was managed. Finally, the Order summary section displays the order and it's total value.
